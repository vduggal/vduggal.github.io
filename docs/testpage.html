<h1>
I am the very model of a modern Major-General, <br>
I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical<br><br>
From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;
I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical,
I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news, (bothered for a rhyme)
With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.
